          was behind that day. That would be checking in devices some days, checking them out, ording parts, staging repairs, and towards the end of my time, helping to redo

    <h2>Skills</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Extremely fast learner - Give me a quick run down and the tools to learn and I can run confidently solo within a week or two if I've never done it before</li>
        <li>Efficient - I've always disliked wasting time so I try to find the most efficient way to do something without comprimising quality</li>
        <li>Quality First - I try to live by the moto of "Measure twice, Cut once" as I generally find it worth the time to make sure it's done right so I don't have to
             go back and do it again
        </li>
